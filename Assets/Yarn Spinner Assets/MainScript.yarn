Evan: So, Vivian brought me out to a jazz bar today. #boxtype:think #emotetype:evanhappy
Evan: She’s been acting a little weird around me since last week, but I’m not really sure what’s wrong. #emotetype:nervous
Evan: She keeps asking me whether I’ve forgotten something, but I’m pretty sure I haven’t missed anything...
